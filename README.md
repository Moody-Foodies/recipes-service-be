# BrainFood Recipe Micro Service
### Summary:
This application acts as a micro service for the BrainFood BE Gateway application. It's responsibility is to make HTTP requests to the external Spoonacular API to retrieve full recipes based on the criteria of nutrients that should be included in the recipe and the maximum amount of time that the recipe should take to prepare and cook. It then restructures the needed data to respond to the BE gateway application to utilize for the FE of the app.
